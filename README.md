This is a blog page I built with Next JS (React framework) following a tutorial on the [next js docs](https://nextjs.org/learn/basics/create-nextjs-app)
# Getting Started
First, run the development server:

```
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```
Open http://localhost:3000 with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.
